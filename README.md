My Random scripts
==============

Some scripts I might use. I might not. Maybe somebody else will.

1. Clean Xubuntu setup

A poem to my future self:


    When I find yourself in times of trouble
    And the netbook is failing me
    Do a clean install and
    wget -qO- https://raw.github.com/minivan/random-scripts/master/os/xubuntu_clean.sh | sh
  

It doesn't rhyme, my future self, but the old you was a lousy poet. The chorus was the last line repeated four times. `C Am G F C`
